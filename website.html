            <h2>Sung Jin-Woo</h2>
            <p>Sung Jinwoo (성진우) is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, he got the chance of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System, giving him the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint. As a result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him by the System, Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's greatest hunter and the second Shadow Monarch.</p>
            <p>Jinwoo is a handsome and muscular young man with gray eyes, black hair, and sharp facial features. When using his powers or agitated, his eyes glow bright purple. He is almost always seen wearing dark colors, particularly black.

                Back when he was weak, Jinwoo was a short, scrawny young man with hair long enough to completely cover his ears. His face was also very boyish, which made him look even younger than his sister Jinah, and he tended to dress in a simple blue hoodie and jeans.</p>

As a testament to this, he was able to quash the Statue of God, beat Thomas Andre to the brink of death while still holding back, kill the Beast Monarch in four hits, and fight on even footing with Antares.
                    Nigh-Invulnerability: Jinwoo possesses almost unparalleled durability and is virtually invulnerable to physical trauma. He is also immune to all diseases, poisonous substances, and debuffs. However, as the System detects alcohol as a poison, Jinwoo can't get drunk.[2]
                    Regenerative Healing Factor: Jinwoo is able to rapidly heal from most injuries he sustains in battle. His healing abilities also accelerate exponentially when he sleeps. -->
